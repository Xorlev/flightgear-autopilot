--------------------

Experiments into control theory in Scala.

Uses RxJava totally unnecessarily to decouple the consumer from the controller.

#### Inspiration

Initial proportional controller & control interface entirely inspired by and converted from http://nakkaya.com/2010/10/07/towards-a-clojure-autopilot-first-steps/
